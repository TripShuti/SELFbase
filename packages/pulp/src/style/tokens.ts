/**
 * `style_v1` — the style token vocabulary.
 *
 * Implements S1 of `docs/SELFBASE_STYLE_VOCABULARY_ADR.md`: the spacing scale plus
 * the parsing contract every later stage reuses.
 *
 * ## Why tokens rather than values (D1, D2)
 *
 * Every leaf here is an enum member. That is the security boundary, not the
 * vocabulary's *size*: two hundred enum-valued knobs are exactly as safe as
 * five, because the failure modes of free-form styling (URL exfiltration,
 * embedded script, layout escape) come from unbounded values, never from
 * abundant options. So this file is expected to grow, and growing it is a
 * maintenance decision — every token costs a web mapping and an RN mapping,
 * forever — not a safety one.
 *
 * Storing names rather than values is what keeps theming, host re-skinning,
 * dark mode, and portable/forkable trees possible later without rewriting a
 * single stored tree.
 *
 * ## Why this file has no CSS in it (D4)
 *
 * Pulp is renderer-agnostic and ships an RN renderer alongside the web one, so
 * the vocabulary lives here and the *mappings* live per-renderer. The web
 * mapping happens to be Tailwind classes; that is an implementation detail of
 * one renderer and must never leak into stored props.
 */

/**
 * Spacing scale. Values are names; the web renderer maps them onto Tailwind's
 * 4px steps (which the codebase already used implicitly via
 * `Container.gap: n × 0.25rem`), and the RN renderer maps them to dp.
