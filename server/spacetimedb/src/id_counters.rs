//! Per-table id allocator backed by a single counter row per table.
//!
//! Replaces the historical `iter().max() + 1` pattern (which was O(N) per
//! insert) with a single primary-key lookup + update on the `id_counter`
//! table. The counter row is created lazily on first allocation, seeded
//! from the current `max(id)` of the owning table — so existing
//! deployments migrate transparently with one O(N) scan per table per
//! cold start.
//!
//! This is the pattern SpacetimeDB's own docs recommend for
//! "guaranteed sequential values without gaps" (see Auto-Increment
//! docs / "Concurrency and Gaps"). We prefer it over `#[auto_inc]`
//! because:
//!
//! * `#[auto_inc]` only advances when callers insert with `id = 0`. The
//!   pre-existing data in this database was written with non-zero ids
//!   (via the legacy `next_*_id` helpers), so every table's internal
//!   sequence is still at its start value. Switching cold to `id = 0`
//!   would immediately collide with existing rows. The counter table
//!   sidesteps that landmine.
//! * Counter values are gap-free; `auto_inc` skips up to 4096 values
//!   per restart due to its batched persistence strategy.
//! * Migration is implicit and reversible — drop the counter rows and
//!   the next allocation re-seeds.
