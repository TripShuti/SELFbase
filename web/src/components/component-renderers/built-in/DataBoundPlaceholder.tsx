/**
 * Sprint-1 placeholder for Table / Card / List. Form / Input / Button
 * shipped in sprint 4; Table / Card / List await the custom-view runtime ADR.
 *
 * The placeholder is visible — same defence-in-depth stance as
 * `UnregisteredComponentFallback`. We want a workspace running this build
 * against a future-modified page tree to *see* that a data-bound block is
 * present but not yet rendering, rather than silently dropping it.
 *
 * Children (Form, Card, List all `accepts_children = true`) are passed
 * through, so a Form's inner Input components still render even though the
 * Form's submit wiring is stubbed.
