/**
 * Delivery-to-paint instrumentation for the M3 back-out bar.
 *
 * The ADR's flag gate is quantitative, not qualitative: the repeater sidebar
 * ships only if p99 delivery-to-paint lands within 1.5× of the bespoke one on
 * the churn and deep-nesting scenarios, with no remount storms under sort or
 * filter churn. "Feels the same" is explicitly not sufficient on its own, so
 * both implementations record through this module and are compared on the same
 * clock.
 *
 * What one sample measures: the moment a row delivery is observed, through
 * React's render and commit, to the first frame the browser paints after it.
 * That is the number a user actually experiences — it deliberately includes
 * materialization, reconciliation, and layout rather than just the JS.
 *
 * Read the numbers from devtools:
 *
 *     __selfbasePaintMetrics.report()
 *     __selfbasePaintMetrics.reset()
