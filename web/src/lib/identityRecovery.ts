/**
 * Identity-drift recovery.
 *
 * Background: every reducer that mutates a row owned by a specific identity
 * (`api_endpoint`, `api_endpoint_key`, `api_field_mapping`, etc.) gates the
 * mutation on `ctx.sender() == row.created_by`. When the SDK's connected
 * identity diverges from what the user expects to be — e.g. a stale tab that
 * connected before a database wipe got an ephemeral identity, or the
 * persisted SpacetimeDB token in localStorage outlived the OIDC session that
 * minted it — those reducers correctly reject with messages like
 * `"Only the endpoint creator can manage API keys"`.
 *
 * The user is shown UI for resources they can't actually touch, every
 * mutation 401s, and the only escape is "open DevTools and figure out what
 * happened". That's a footgun, especially after rare events like a server
 * wipe or OIDC re-issuance.
 *
 * Defense: when the UI catches one of these "you don't own this" errors on
 * an action the user *should* have been able to perform (the UI wouldn't
 * have rendered the button otherwise), we treat that as a signal that the
 * local SDK identity is out of sync. We:
 *
 *   1. Stash a human-readable reason in sessionStorage so the login screen
 *      can explain why we kicked them.
 *   2. Drop the persisted SpacetimeDB token for this workspace so the next
 *      connection starts from the OIDC token (or native login) rather than
 *      the stale identity token.
 *   3. Sign out of OIDC if configured (forces a full re-auth round-trip),
 *      otherwise reload — `AuthGate` will surface `LoginGate` and the user
 *      logs back in fresh.
 *
 * See `docs/SECURITY.md` §10 for the threat model and rationale.
