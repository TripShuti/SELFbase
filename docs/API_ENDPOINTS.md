# Custom API Endpoints

SELFbase lets you expose any database (SELFbase's tabular page type) as a versioned
REST API. Once you create an endpoint, every row in that database becomes
addressable over HTTP, with field-level mappings, per-property type
coercion, optional API-key authentication, and an auto-generated OpenAPI
3.1 spec for documentation and SDK generation.

This document describes:

1. The feature surface (what endpoints look like to a caller).
2. The configuration UI under **Workspace Settings → API Endpoints**.
3. The environment-variable contract that controls which HTTP handler
   actually serves traffic.
4. The override hook used by hosted (and any operator who wants to
   front SELFbase with their own gateway).

If you're a self-hoster running SELFbase out of the box, the default Next.js
handler is enabled and routes live at `/api/e/{slug}` — there is nothing
else to configure.

## 1. What the API looks like

Each endpoint exposes a CRUD-shaped REST surface scoped to a single
database.

```
GET    /api/e/{slug}             # list rows
POST   /api/e/{slug}             # create a row (atomic)
GET    /api/e/{slug}/{rowId}     # read a row
PATCH  /api/e/{slug}/{rowId}     # partial update (atomic)
DELETE /api/e/{slug}/{rowId}     # soft delete

GET    /api/e/{slug}/_schema     # OpenAPI 3.1 spec for this endpoint
```

The set of methods exposed is configurable per endpoint — turning off
`POST` or `DELETE` is a hard 405, not a permission check.

### Request and response bodies

Bodies are JSON. The shape is driven entirely by the **Field Mappings**
configured for the endpoint:

- The mapping's `apiFieldName` is what shows up in the JSON.
- The property's type (`Text`, `Number`, `Date`, `Select`, `MultiSelect`,
  `Relation`, `Checkbox`, `Url`, `Person`) determines how SELFbase coerces
  the JSON value into a SpacetimeDB `PropertyValue`.
- Mappings flagged `requiredOnCreate` are required on `POST`.
- Mappings flagged `readOnly` are accepted on `GET` responses but
  rejected on `POST` / `PATCH`.

When an endpoint is created, `create_api_endpoint` auto-generates one
mapping per column of the database's **effective schema** — including
columns inherited through `DatabaseSchema.parent_schema_id` (see
`docs/FEATURE_schema_inheritance.md`). Inherited mappings reference the
parent's original `property_definition_id`.

The full encoding rules live in
[`web/src/lib/api-endpoint/codec.ts`](../web/src/lib/api-endpoint/codec.ts).

### Atomicity

`POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` use the dedicated reducers
`create_database_row`, `update_database_row`, and `delete_database_row`.
Each reducer commits the page mutation **and** all property-value
mutations in a single SpacetimeDB transaction. There is no partial-row
failure mode visible to API callers.

`POST` is also idempotent on the `Idempotency-Key` header — passing the
same key twice within the marker retention window returns the original
row instead of creating a second one. The handler implements this by
generating a UUID, passing it to the reducer as `client_request_id`, and
then resolving the resulting `page_id` from the `DatabaseRowMarker`
table.

### Authentication

Endpoints have a single boolean: **Auth required**. When on, callers must
present `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Keys are minted in the UI and
stored as SHA-256 hashes (the plaintext is shown exactly once). Each
successful authenticated request bumps `last_used_at` via the
`touch_api_endpoint_key` reducer so abandoned keys are easy to find.

When **Auth required** is off, the endpoint is publicly callable. The UI
guards this transition behind a typed-confirmation modal because flipping
that switch on a write-enabled endpoint exposes mutations to the entire
internet.

### Who can manage endpoints and keys

Endpoints, field mappings, and API keys are **shared workspace
infrastructure**. The reducer family (`update_api_endpoint`,
`delete_api_endpoint`, `create_api_field_mapping`,
`update_api_field_mapping`, `delete_api_field_mapping`,
`create_api_endpoint_key`, `revoke_api_endpoint_key`) routes its
ownership check through `require_creator_or_admin`, so a mutation is
accepted from either:

- the original `created_by` identity, or
- any **workspace admin** (`User.is_admin = true`).

SELFbase's admin model lives entirely on the `User` table:

- The first user to authenticate on a fresh database is auto-promoted
  in `client_connected` / `register` / `login`, so a workspace can never
  start admin-less.
- Subsequent promotions/demotions go through the admin-only
  `set_user_admin(target_identity, is_admin)` reducer, which refuses to
  demote the last remaining admin so a workspace can never *become*
  admin-less either.
- The Members panel
  ([`web/src/components/MembersSettings.tsx`](../web/src/components/MembersSettings.tsx))
  surfaces every authenticated member with an "Admin" badge and gives
  admins Promote/Demote controls.

This means an endpoint orphaned by a stale-tab/wipe accident or an
OIDC `sub` rotation can be deleted by any other admin in the workspace
without admin SQL — see `docs/SECURITY.md` §9 for the full failure
mode this resolves.

Extension and AI-user reducers deliberately **do not** honor `is_admin`
— those rows are per-installer / per-creator by design (see
`docs/SELFBASE_EXTENSIONS_SECURITY.MD`).

### Audit log

Every request — successful or not — is appended to the `ApiCallLog`
table by the `log_api_call` reducer. The endpoint detail view in the UI
surfaces the most recent 20 entries per endpoint (timestamp, method,
path, status, latency, caller IP).

### OpenAPI

`GET /api/e/{slug}/_schema` returns a freshly built OpenAPI 3.1 document
describing the endpoint's request/response schemas, allowed methods, and
auth requirements. The same URL is what the **Show API docs** button in
the UI hands to the lazy-loaded
[Stoplight Elements](https://github.com/stoplightio/elements) viewer.

---

## 2. UI: Workspace Settings → API Endpoints

The settings panel
([`web/src/components/ApiEndpointsSettings.tsx`](../web/src/components/ApiEndpointsSettings.tsx))
covers the full lifecycle:

- **Create** — pick a database, choose a slug, choose allowed methods.
  `Auth required` defaults to `true`.
- **Edit** — toggle auth, manage field mappings, mint and revoke API
  keys, view recent calls, view live API docs.
- **Delete** — tears down the endpoint plus all of its mappings and
  keys.

Slugs are validated against a reserved list (`_schema`, `health`,
`docs`, …) and may not begin with `_`. The reserved list lives in
`server/spacetimedb/src/lib.rs` next to `validate_slug`.

The URL displayed in the UI (the **Endpoint URL**, the **curl** example,
the **OpenAPI Schema** link, and the slug-prefix preview in the create
form) is rendered through the template resolver — see the next section.

## 3. Environment-variable contract

There is exactly **one** environment variable involved:

| Variable                            | Where read                       | Default                            | Effect                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELFBASE_API_URL_TEMPLATE` | Browser **and** server (Next.js) | `{origin}/api/e/{endpointSlug}`    | Controls the URL the UI advertises, **and** whether the bundled `/api/e/...` Next.js handler serves traffic. When set to a non-default value the bundled handler self-disables (returns `410 Gone` with a `Location` header that points at the templated URL). |

Recognised placeholders inside the template:

| Placeholder        | Replaced with                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{origin}`         | `window.location.origin` (or the request origin on the server)      |
| `{workspaceSlug}`  | The current workspace slug, parsed from `/workspace/{slug}/...`     |
| `{endpointSlug}`   | The endpoint's `slug` column                                        |

### Examples

**Self-hosted SELFbase (default — leave unset):**

```
# unset → resolves to {origin}/api/e/{endpointSlug}
# e.g.  https://selfbase.example.com/api/e/fruit
```

**Subdomain-per-workspace gateway (hosted's deployment):**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SELFBASE_API_URL_TEMPLATE='https://{workspaceSlug}.api.selfbase.example/{endpointSlug}'
```

A workspace `acme` with an endpoint `fruit` resolves to
`https://acme.api.selfbase.example/fruit`. The bundled Next.js handler stops
serving traffic and instead 410s with a `Location` header pointing at
the templated URL.

**Path-per-workspace gateway:**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SELFBASE_API_URL_TEMPLATE='https://api.example.com/{workspaceSlug}/{endpointSlug}'
```

**Custom origin, default path layout (e.g. moving APIs onto a CDN
hostname while keeping the bundled handler):**

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SELFBASE_API_URL_TEMPLATE='https://api.example.com/api/e/{endpointSlug}'
# Note: this also disables the bundled handler because the template no
# longer matches the literal default.
```

---

## 4. The override hook

Operators who set a custom `NEXT_PUBLIC_SELFBASE_API_URL_TEMPLATE` are
expected to provide their own HTTP handler at the templated URL. To make
that easy, the implementation is split into:

- **A platform-agnostic library** at
  [`web/src/lib/api-endpoint/`](../web/src/lib/api-endpoint/).
  Imports nothing from `next/server`, the file system, or any host
  runtime.
- **A default Next.js handler** at
  [`web/app/api/e/`](../web/app/api/e/) that wires the library to
  Next's `Request`/`Response` model and reads `SELFBASE_STDB_*` env vars to
  talk to SpacetimeDB.

To bring your own handler, depend on `web/src/lib/api-endpoint`
from your runtime of choice and call `dispatchApiEndpointRequest`. The
library accepts an injected `StdbTransport`, so you can either reuse
the bundled `HttpStdbTransport` (HTTP API client) or supply your own —
for example, calling SpacetimeDB over its WebSocket SDK from inside a
Cloudflare Worker.

The minimum a custom handler needs to do:

1. Resolve the workspace from the request (subdomain, header, JWT —
   whatever you've decided on at the gateway).
2. Look up the per-workspace STDB service identity / token.
3. Construct an `HttpStdbTransport` (or your own) targeting that
   workspace's database.
4. Authenticate the request (API key, session, mTLS — your call).
5. Call `dispatchApiEndpointRequest({ transport, auth, request, ... })`.
6. Return the resulting `Response`.

For a complete reference implementation, see the hosted Cloudflare
Worker at `cloud-host:workers/api/`.

### Why split it this way?

The split exists so that:

- Self-hosters get a working API surface with zero extra infrastructure.
- Hosted offerings (hosted, vendor deployments, BYO gateways) can
  do the things you can't reasonably do in-process — wildcard
  subdomains, edge rate limiting, in-isolate caching, regional
  failover — without having to fork the OSS code path.
- Both code paths share the exact same endpoint configuration,
  type-coercion, OpenAPI generation, and atomic reducers, so behaviour
  stays consistent between deployments.
